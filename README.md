# ESP32-S3 Touch Display Project for JC3248W535

This project is designed to work with the JC3248W535 (AXS15231B, 320√ó480, QSPI) touch display, powered by the ESP32-S3-N16R8V microcontroller, using LVGL 9.2.2 and Arduino GFX 1.6.0.

## üéØ Purpose

The system provides a fast and convenient way to run a user interface (UI) created in SquareLine Studio on the ESP32-S3 platform.
For correct integration:

* When creating the SquareLine project, set:
  Project type: CMake / Eclipse / VSCode with SDL (for PC development and simulation).
  LVGL major version: 9.2.2
  Resolution: 320√ó480
  Color depth: 16-bit
* Enable the ‚ÄúFlat export‚Äù option in the SquareLine project settings.
* Use `lvgl.h` as the include path (instead of `lvgl/lvgl.h`).
* Export UI files into the `src/ui/` folder from SquareLine Studio.
* Do not enable multilanguage support.
* After PlatformIO download LVGL library into the project folder::

  ```
  .pio/libdeps/esp32-s3-n16r8v/lvgl/
  ```

  you must:

  1. Rename the file `lv_conf_template.h` ‚Üí `lv_conf.h`.
  2. Inside `lv_conf.h`, change:

     ```c
     /* clang-format off */
     #if 0 /*Set it to "1" to enable content*/
     ```

     to:

     ```c
     /* clang-format off */
     #if 1 /*Set it to "1" to enable content*/
     ```
